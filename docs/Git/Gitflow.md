### Cygwin

For Windows users who wish to use the automated install, it is suggested that you install [Cygwin](http://www.cygwin.com/)
first to install tools like `git`, `util-linux` and `wget` (with those three being packages that can be selected
during installation). Then simply run this command from a Cygwin shell in your `$HOME`:

	$ wget -q -O - --no-check-certificate https://github.com/nvie/gitflow/raw/develop/contrib/gitflow-installer.sh stable
