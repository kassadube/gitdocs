            "text": "Introducing GitFlow\n\n\n\n\nwhat is git flow\n\n\nGitFlow is a branching model for Git, created by Vincent Driessen.\nit is very well suited to collaboration and scaling the development team.\n\n\nKey Benefits\n\n\nParallel Development\n\n\nOne of the great things about GitFlow is that it makes parallel development very easy,by isolating new development from finished work. New development (such as features and non-emergency bug fixes) is done in feature branches, and is only merged back into main body of code when the developer(s) is happy that the code is ready for release.\nAlthough interruptions are a BadThing(tm), if you are asked to switch from one task to another, all you need to do is commit your changes and then create a new feature branch for your new task. When that task is done, just checkout your original feature branch and you can continue where you left off.\n\n\nCollaboration\n\n\nFeature branches also make it easier for two or more developers to collaborate on the same feature, because each feature branch is a sandbox where the only changes are the changes necessary to get the new feature working. That makes it very easy to see and follow what each collaborator is doing.\n\n\nRelease Staging Area\n\n\nAs new development is completed, it gets merged back into the develop branch, which is a staging area for all completed features that haven\u2019t yet been released. So when the next release is branched off of develop, it will automatically contain all of the new stuff that has been finished.\n\n\nSupport For Emergency Fixes\n\n\nGitFlow supports hotfix branches - branches made from a tagged release. You can use these to make an emergency change, safe in the knowledge that the hotfix will only contain your emergency fix. There\u2019s no risk that you\u2019ll accidentally merge in new development at the same time.\n\n\nImplementation\n\n\nDecentralized but centralized\n\n\nThe repository setup that we use and that works well with this branching model, is that with a central \u201ctruth\u201d repo. Note that this repo is only considered to be the central one (since Git is a DVCS, there is no such thing as a central repo at a technical level). We will refer to this repo as origin, since this name is familiar to all Git users.\n\n\nEach developer pulls and pushes to origin.\n\n\n\n\nThe main branches\n\n\n\n\nThe central repo holds two main branches with an infinite lifetime.\n\n\n\n\nmaster\n\n\ndevelop\n\n\n\n\nThe master branch at origin is the default branch when creating new repository at Git. Parallel to the master branch, another branch exists called develop.\n\n\nWe consider origin/master to be the main branch where the source code of HEAD always reflects a production-ready state.\n\n\nWe consider origin/develop to be the main branch where the source code of HEAD always reflects a state with the latest delivered development changes for the next release.\n\n\nWhen the source code in the develop branch reaches a stable point and is ready to be released, all of the changes should be merged back into master somehow and then tagged with a release number.\n\n\nTherefore, each time when changes are merged back into master, this is a new production release by \ndefinition\n.\nso that theoretically, we could use a Git hook script to automatically build and roll-out our software to our production servers everytime there was a commit on master.\n\n\nSupporting branches\n\n\nNext to the main branches master and develop, our development model uses a variety of supporting branches to aid parallel development between team members, ease tracking of features, prepare for production releases and to assist in quickly fixing live production problems. Unlike the main branches, these branches always have a limited life time, since they will be removed eventually.\n\n\nThe different types of branches we may use are:\n\n\n\n\nFeature branches\n\n\nRelease branches\n\n\nHotfix branches\n\n\nBugfix branches\n\n\n\n\nEach of these branches have a specific purpose and are bound to strict rules as to which branches may be their originating branch and which branches must be their merge targets.\n\n\nBy no means are these branches \u201cspecial\u201d from a technical perspective. The branch types are categorized by how we use them. They are of course plain old Git branches.\n\n\nFeature Branches\n\n\n\n\nMust branch off from:\n\n \n develop \n\n\nMust merge back into:\n\n\n develop \n\n\nBranch naming convention:\n\n\n feature_< nameOfFeature > \n\n\nFeature branches are used to develop new features for the upcoming or a distant future release.\n\n\nFeature branch exists as long as the feature is in development, but will eventually be merged back into develop to add the new feature to the upcoming release.\n\n\nCreating Feature branch\n\n\nWhen starting work on a new feature, branch off from the develop branch.\n\n\n$ git checkout develop\n$ git checkout -b feature_newFeature\n# Switched to a new branch \"feature_newFeature\"\n\n\n\n\nIncorporating a finished feature on develop\n\n\n$ git checkout develop\n#Switched to branch 'develop'\n$ git merge --no-ff feature_newFeature\n#Updating ea1b82a..05e9557\n#(Summary of changes)\n$ git branch -d feature_newFeature\n#Deleted branch myfeature (was 05e9557).\n$ git push origin develop\n\n\n\n\nThe --no-ff flag causes the merge to always create a new commit object, even if the merge could be performed with a fast-forward. This avoids losing information about the historical existence of a feature branch and groups together all commits that together added the feature.\n\nIn the latter case, it is impossible to see from the Git history which of the commit objects together have implemented a feature\u2014you would have to manually read all the log messages.\n\n\nRelease Branches\n\n\nMust branch off from:\n\n \n develop \n\n\nMust merge back into:\n\n\n develop and master \n\n\nBranch naming convention:\n\n\n release_< * > \n\n\nRelease branches support preparation of a new production release.They allow for last-minute dotting of i\u2019s and crossing t\u2019s. Furthermore, they allow for minor bug fixes and preparing meta-data for a release (version number, build dates, etc.). By doing all of this work on a release branch, the develop branch is cleared to receive features for the next big release.\n\n\nThe key moment to branch off a new release branch from develop is when develop (almost) reflects the desired state of the new release. At least all features that are targeted for the release-to-be-built must be merged in to develop at this point in time.\n\n\nCreating Feature branch\n\n\nRelease branches are created from the develop branch.\n\n\n$ git checkout -b release_1.2 develop\n#Switched to a new branch \"release_1.2\"\n$ ./bump-version.sh 1.2\n#Files modified successfully, version bumped to 1.2.\n$ git commit -a -m \"Bumped version number to 1.2\"\n#[release-1.2 74d9424] Bumped version number to 1.2\n#1 files changed, 1 insertions(+), 1 deletions(-)\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter creating a new branch and switching to it, we bump the version number.\n\nThen, the bumped version number is committed.\n\n\nThis new branch may exist there for a while, until the release may be rolled out definitely. During that time, bug fixes may be applied in this branch (rather than on the develop branch). Adding large new features here is strictly prohibited. They must be merged into develop, and therefore, wait for the next big release.\n\n\nFinishing a release branch\n\n\nWhen the state of the release branch is ready to become a real release, some actions need to be carried out. First, the release branch is merged into master (since every commit on master is a new release by definition, remember). Next, that commit on master must be tagged for easy future reference to this historical version. Finally, the changes made on the release branch need to be merged back into develop, so that future releases also contain these bug fixes.\n\n\n\n$ git checkout master\n#Switched to branch 'master'\n$ git merge --no-ff release_1.2\n#Merge made by recursive.\n#(Summary of changes)\n$ git tag -a 1.2\n\n\n\n\n\nThe release is now done, and tagged for future reference. \n\nTo keep the changes made in the release branch, we need to merge those back into develop, though. \n\n\n\n$ git checkout develop\n#Switched to branch 'develop'\n$ git merge --no-ff release_1.2\n#Merge made by recursive.\n#(Summary of changes)\n\n\n\n\n\nThis step may well lead to a merge conflict (probably even, since we have changed the version number). If so, fix it and commit.\n\n\nNow we are really done and the release branch may be removed, since we don\u2019t need it anymore.\n\n\n$ git branch -d release_1.2\n#Deleted branch release_1.2 (was ff452fe).\n\n\n\n\nHotfix branches\n\n\nMay branch off from:\n\n \n master \n\n\nMust merge back into:\n\n\n develop and master \n\n\nBranch naming convention:\n\n\n hotfix_1.2.1 \n\n\nHotfix branches are very much like release branches in that they are also meant to prepare for a new production release, albeit unplanned.\nThey arise from the necessity to act immediately upon an undesired state of a live production version. When a critical bug in a production version must be resolved immediately, a hotfix branch may be branched off from the corresponding tag on the master branch that marks the production version.\n\n\nThe essence is that work of team members (on the develop branch) can continue, while another person is preparing a quick production fix.\n\n\nCreating the hotfix branch\n\n\nHotfix branches are created from the master branch. For example, say version 1.2 is the current production release running live and causing troubles due to a severe bug. But changes on develop are yet unstable. We may then branch off a hotfix branch and start fixing the problem:\n\n\n\n$ git checkout -b hotfix_1.2.1 master\n#Switched to a new branch \"hotfix-1.2.1\"\n$ ./bump-version.sh 1.2.1\n#Files modified successfully, version bumped to 1.2.1.\n$ git commit -a -m \"Bumped version number to 1.2.1\"\n#[hotfix_1.2.1 41e61bb] Bumped version number to 1.2.1\n#1 files changed, 1 insertions(+), 1 deletions(-)\n\n\n\n\n\nFinishing a hotfix branch\n\n\nWhen finished, the bugfix needs to be merged back into master, but also needs to be merged back into develop, in order to safeguard that the bugfix is included in the next release as well. This is completely similar to how release branches are finished.\n\n\nFirst, update master and tag the release.\n\n\n$ git checkout master\n#Switched to branch 'master'\n$ git merge --no-ff hotfix_1.2.1\n#Merge made by recursive.\n#(Summary of changes)\n$ git tag -a 1.2.1\n\n\n\n\nNext, include the bugfix in develop, too:\n\n\n$ git checkout develop\n#Switched to branch 'master'\n$ git merge --no-ff hotfix_1.2.1\n#Merge made by recursive.\n#(Summary of changes)\n\n\n\n\nFinally, remove the temporary branch:\n\n\n$ git branch -d hotfix-1.2.1\n#Deleted branch hotfix-1.2.1 (was abbe5d6).\n\n\n\n\nSummary",
